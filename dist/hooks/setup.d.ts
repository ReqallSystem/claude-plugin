/**
 * UserPromptSubmit hook — API Key Setup
 *
 * Checks if REQALL_API_KEY is configured. If not, instructs the agent
 * to prompt the user for their API key and install it at the user level.
 *
 * Exits silently when the key is already present so other hooks
 * (context retrieval, etc.) proceed normally.
